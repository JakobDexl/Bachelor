T1: Categorical
	normal: nothing has positive influence on class normal
		If false prediction occured a heatmap shows what supports anormal 
	anormal:nothing has positive influence on class normal
    Binary:
	Nothing has positive influence on prediction 
	Every image was correct classified
    The gradient of 1. and 0. always is zero. Why?

T2: Categorical
	normal: Much has negative influence on class normal
		If false prediction occured a heatmap shows what supports anormal 
	anormal:nothing has negative influence on class normal
    Binary:
	normal:  many negative influence
	anormal: just one pred was a little smaller than 1 
	Every image was correct classified
    The gradient of 1. always is zero. Why?

T2: Categorical
	normal: class anormal--more positive maps than negative--negative is similar to T2 normal negative
	anormal: with normal as class map all are zero because predictions are correct
    Binary:
	Nothing
